## Version: v0.1.2-dev
**Status:** Completed
**Branch:** 0.1.2-dev

### Yunexal Panel

#### 🌟 New Features
- **Installation Scripts:** Added ASCII art logo to install and uninstall scripts for better branding experience.
- **UI Upgrade:** Implemented sidebar navigation with dedicated pages for "Nodes" and "System Logs".
- **Live Logs:** Added real-time log viewer with log level filtering, file history, and auto-scroll.
- **Overview Dashboard:** Created a new landing page with high-level stats (Total Nodes, Online Count) and configuration.
- **Dynamic Configuration:** Added ability to change the Panel Name directly from the UI, persisting settings to `.env`.
- **Consistent Branding:** Dynamic panel name is now applied across all page titles, headers, and footers.

#### 🚀 Enhancements
- **Code Refactoring:** Split monolithic `main.rs` into modular structure (`handlers`, `models`, `state`).
- **Redis Resilience:** Panel now gracefully degrades if Redis is misconfigured or unreachable, logging the error and proceeding without caching.
- **Performance:** Implemented persistent Redis connection manager to reduce overhead.
- **UI Polish:** Added main sidebar toggle (hamburger menu) and fixed 100vh layout scrolling.
- **Navigation:** Reorganized routes; Nodes list moved to `/nodes`, Overview is now `/`.
